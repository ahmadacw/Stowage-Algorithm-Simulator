# Stowage-Algorithm-Simulator
Two discreet projects rolled into one.
An algorithm to stow cargo on and from a ship that is traveling a path while reporting all relevant errors to a file.
A simulator to test that the algorithms preforms only legal moves and reports legal error codes.
The Simulator also utilizes SO files to load shared objects so it can be ran on multiple algorithms by supplying the paths to the SO files.
